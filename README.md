A short preview of my last projects

## 1. Repel pigeons with AI drone using CNN and OpenCV.

An AI-powered drone system designed to detect and track pigeons using CNN and OpenCV. <br>
The system leverages movement detection, object detection, and object tracking to identify pigeons and initiate autonomous navigation to chase and repel them.
Using ResNet50 with Transfer Learning, the project achieves high accuracy and optimizes performance for real-time applications. <br>
The drone autonomously navigates and repels pigeons, enhancing urban spaces with minimal human intervention. <br>
